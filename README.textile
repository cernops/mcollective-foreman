h1. Foreman-mcollective

h3. A mcollective discovery plugin that finds information about your nodes in Foreman.

h2. Settings

This repository includes the bare minimum files to make a foreman discovery plugin work.
Normally you would set up the foreman url and certificates with puppet using the 
template provided in templates/config.cfg.erb. 
You can also take that file, modify it yourself, put it in /etc/mcollective/client.cfg  
and use it as a standalone, non-puppetized plugin.
You may use Kerberized access to foreman by setting plugin.foreman.use_krb to 1 or true in the config file.
You may add plugin.foreman.collective_fact to define a foreman element to filter all queries with the value of the collective
thus avoiding to fetch all the nodes registered in foreman each time. For instance, it may be set to parent_hostgroup,
or to facts.hostgroup_0 for the hostgroup_0 fact.

h2. Usage

Fetch hosts given a sample condition
<pre> $ mco xxxxx --dm=foreman --do='hostgroup = samplehostgroup' </pre>

Fetch hosts given several conditions 
<pre> $ mco xxxxx --dm=foreman --do='params.owner = owner1 AND ip=127.0.0.1' </pre>

You can now also use -F in the command line to add additional filtering using facts. For instance
<pre> $ mco xxxxx -F is_virtual=true -F operatingsystem=CentOS --dm=foreman --do='params.owner = owner1 AND ip=127.0.0.1' </pre>
